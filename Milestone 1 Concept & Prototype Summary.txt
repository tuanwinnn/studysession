Problem Statement: Currently, Canvas has no native tools for students to coordinate informal study sessions with 
classmates. Students use Discord, but general chats are too broad, not everyone checks them, and tracking 
individual sessions becomes chaotic. This makes it difficult to find study partners with compatible schedules, 
leading to isolation and everyone just doing their own thing.

Proposed Solution: Study sessions would be integrated into the course, so only students enrolled in the course can 
see them. Students can create study sessions at specific times and broadcast what / where / when they plan to study. 
Optionally, they can also tag specific topics or assignments they want to work on. Other enrolled students can 
browse upcoming sessions and join ones that fit their schedule and needs. The main idea is to make it easier to 
find study partners in your class. 
For M2, the focus will be on core CRUD operations: creating sessions, joining/leaving sessions, and viewing session 
details. M3 will add user authentication, course enrollment verification, and filtering/search capabilities. 
The app will use Flask with SQLAlchemy for data persistence, keeping the architecture simple and maintainable. 

Primary Users: 
Students
Need to find study partners without awkward outreach
Need to see what times work for multiple people
Teaching Assistants:
Need to see what topics students are struggling with based on session frequency
Need to optimally promote their office hours or review sessions

MVP Features: 
 Students can view all upcoming study sessions for a course
 Students can create a study session with a date, time, and location
 Students can add an optional topic or assignment tag to a session
 Students can join an existing study session
Students can leave a session they previously joined
Students can view the list of participants in a session
Students can delete a study session they created
Students can edit details of their own session
Students can filter sessions by date
Students can filter sessions by topic/assignment
Systems prevent joining sessions that have already occurred
Systems shows the session creator's name

Stretch Goals: 
Recurring session support (ex, “Every Tuesday 3-5 PM)
Session chat/comments for coordination before meeting
Integration with the school room booking system for automatic location suggestions

Success Criteria: 
Demo: creating and joining a study session 
Display a filtered view of sessions by topic, showing only relevant results
Demonstrate session lifecycle: creating, joining, completing, and cleaning up
